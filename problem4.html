    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatanatyam">Iam intrested in Bharthanatyam. Bharatanatyam is an Indian classical dance form that comes from Tamil Nadu, India.[1][2] It is a classical dance form recognized by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, and expresses South Indian religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism and in general of Hinduism.[3][4][5]

        A description of precursors of Bharatanatyam from the Natya Shastra date from around 500 BCE–500 CE[6][7] and
        those in the ancient Tamil epic Silappatikaram date to around 171 CE.[8][9] Temple sculptures of the 6th to 9th
        century CE suggest dance was a refined performance art by the mid-1st millennium CE.[10][11] Sadiraattam, which
        was renamed Bharatanatyam in 1932, is the oldest classical dance tradition in India.[12]</blockquote>
